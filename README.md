# Project 2 - Book Store (DLL Adapter)
- My submission for Computer Science 131-06, Section 06
- Objective: To implement a custom doubly linked list class named DoublyLinkedList and to implement a wrapper class (aka an adapter) named BookStore that allows user code to interact directly with a simulation of a bookstore, while avoiding direct interaction with an actual DoublyLinkedList.
- Disclaimer: This is a project for my CPSC 131 Data Structures Class, created by Professor Peralta at CSUF
